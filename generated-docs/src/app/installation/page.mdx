| **Rhinoceros 3D** | Version 7 or later | Must be installed and licensed |
| **Operating System** | Windows 10/11 (64-bit) | macOS not currently supported |
| **.NET Framework** | 4.8 | Usually pre-installed on Windows 10/11 |

<Note>
  Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD checks for Rhino 7 installation via the Windows Registry. Ensure Rhino is properly installed before proceeding.
</Note>

### Hardware Requirements

Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD runs both Rhino and AutoCAD simultaneously, so your system should meet the combined requirements:

- **Processor**: Multi-core Intel/AMD processor (64-bit)
- **RAM**: 16 GB minimum, 32 GB recommended
- **Graphics**: OpenGL 4.1 capable GPU with 4GB VRAM
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for optimal performance
- **Display**: 1920x1080 minimum resolution

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

Ensure both AutoCAD and Rhino are installed and working correctly:

1. **Install AutoCAD 2024** or later from Autodesk
2. **Install Rhino 7** or later from McNeel
3. **Verify Rhino** by launching it and confirming your license is active
4. **Verify AutoCAD** by launching it and creating a new drawing

### Step 2: Download Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD

Download the latest release of Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD:

<Note>
  Download link will be provided by Bimorph Digital Engineering.
</Note>

The download includes:
- `Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD.bundle` - The AutoCAD plugin package
- Documentation and example files

### Step 3: Install the Plugin

**Automatic Installation:**

1. Close AutoCAD if it's running
2. Run the installer or extract the bundle to:
   ```
   %APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD.bundle\
   ```
3. The plugin will load automatically when AutoCAD starts

**Manual Installation:**

1. Extract the downloaded archive
2. Copy the `Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD.bundle` folder to:
   ```
   C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\
   ```
3. Restart AutoCAD

### Step 4: Verify Installation

1. **Launch AutoCAD** and open or create a drawing
2. **Type `RHINO`** at the command line and press Enter
3. **Rhino should launch** inside AutoCAD (first launch may take 30-60 seconds)
4. **Type `GRASSHOPPER`** to open the Grasshopper editor
5. **Look for the AutoCAD tab** in the Grasshopper component palette

<Note>
  The first launch initializes Rhino's geometry kernel and may take longer than subsequent launches.
</Note>

### Step 5: Test the Connection

Create a simple test to verify everything is working:

1. In Grasshopper, add a **"Get AutoCAD Documents"** component
2. The component should show your open AutoCAD document(s)
3. Add a **Circle** component and connect it to geometry preview
4. You should see the circle previewed in AutoCAD's viewport

## Plugin Commands

Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD adds the following commands to AutoCAD:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `RHINO` | Opens the Rhino viewport inside AutoCAD |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Rhino Not Found" Error

**Symptom:** AutoCAD displays "Rhino 7 not found" when running RHINO command.

**Solution:**
1. Verify Rhino 7 is installed
2. Check the registry key exists: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\McNeel\Rhinoceros\7.0\Install`
3. Reinstall Rhino if the registry key is missing

#### Plugin Not Loading

**Symptom:** The RHINO and GRASSHOPPER commands are not recognized.

**Solution:**
1. Verify the bundle is in the correct location:
   ```
   %APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD.bundle\
   ```
2. Check the `PackageContents.xml` file exists in the bundle
3. Ensure AutoCAD's `SECURELOAD` setting allows the plugin

#### Slow First Launch

**Symptom:** First launch of Rhino takes 30-60 seconds.

**This is normal.** Rhino's geometry kernel must initialize on first use. Subsequent launches are much faster.

#### Assembly Load Errors

**Symptom:** Errors about missing assemblies or RhinoCommon.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure Rhino 7 is properly installed
2. Check that the Rhino installation path is correct
3. Try repairing the Rhino installation

#### AutoCAD Crashes on Launch

**Symptom:** AutoCAD crashes when loading Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD.

**Solution:**
1. Check for conflicting plugins
2. Verify .NET Framework 4.8 is installed
3. Update graphics drivers
4. Try running AutoCAD as Administrator
