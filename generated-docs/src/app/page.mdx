# Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD

Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD brings the power of Rhinoceros 3D and Grasshopper directly into AutoCAD, enabling advanced NURBS modeling, computational design workflows, and bidirectional geometry exchange without leaving the AutoCAD environment. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD requires Rhino 7 and AutoCAD 2024 or later.
</Note>

## Getting Started {{ id: 'getting-started' }}

Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD transforms your AutoCAD environment into a powerful computational design platform. Create parametric models in Grasshopper, leverage Rhino's advanced NURBS engine, and seamlessly bake results directly into your AutoCAD drawings.

### Key Capabilities

- **Full Rhino Geometry Engine** - Access Rhino's complete NURBS modeling capabilities from within AutoCAD
- **Grasshopper Integration** - Build visual programming definitions that interact directly with AutoCAD documents
- **Bidirectional Conversion** - Convert geometry seamlessly between Rhino and AutoCAD formats for curves, surfaces, meshes, solids, text, dimensions, and more
- **AutoCAD Object Access** - Query and manipulate AutoCAD layers, layouts, linetypes, blocks, and document properties
- **Live Preview** - See Grasshopper geometry previewed in the AutoCAD viewport before baking
- **Block Support** - Create, query, and manipulate AutoCAD block definitions and references, including dynamic block properties

### Quick Example

```
1. Run the GRASSHOPPER command in AutoCAD
2. Use "Get AutoCAD Documents" to access your drawing
3. Create geometry with standard Grasshopper components
4. Convert to AutoCAD format with "To AutoCAD Curve"
5. Bake permanently with "Bake to AutoCAD"
```

## Core Concepts {{ id: 'core-concepts' }}

### Geometry Conversion

Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD provides a complete geometry pipeline between the two applications. Rhino geometry must be explicitly converted to AutoCAD format before baking, and AutoCAD geometry must be converted to Rhino format for manipulation in Grasshopper.

**Supported Geometry Types:**

| Rhino Type | AutoCAD Type | Convert Component |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Curve | Curve/Polyline/Arc | To/From AutoCAD Curve |
| Point3d | DBPoint | To/From AutoCAD Point |
| Mesh | PolyFaceMesh | To/From AutoCAD Mesh |
| Brep | Solid3d | To/From AutoCAD Solid |
| Hatch | Hatch | To/From AutoCAD Hatch |
| TextEntity | DBText/MText | To/From AutoCAD Text |
| Leader | MLeader | To/From AutoCAD Leader |
| Dimension | Dimension | To/From AutoCAD Dimension |

### The Rhino.Inside Pattern

Rhino.Inside.AutoCAD loads Rhino's geometry kernel (RhinoCore) directly into AutoCAD's process space. This means:

- **No File Exchange** - Geometry flows directly between applications in memory
- **Shared Coordinate System** - Both applications work in the same coordinate space with automatic unit conversion
- **Real-time Updates** - Changes in Grasshopper are immediately reflected in AutoCAD previews
- **Full API Access** - Grasshopper components have access to both Rhino and AutoCAD APIs

### Document Model

AutoCAD documents are accessed through the Document components. Each open drawing is represented as a Document object that provides access to:

- **Repositories** - Collections of layers, layouts, linetypes, and block definitions
- **Transactions** - Safe database operations for reading and writing objects
- **Object IDs** - Persistent handles for tracking baked geometry

### Baking Workflow

Geometry created in Grasshopper exists in memory until explicitly "baked" to AutoCAD:

1. **Create** - Use Grasshopper components to generate geometry
2. **Convert** - Transform Rhino geometry to AutoCAD format
3. **Configure** - Set layer, color, and linetype with Bake Settings
4. **Bake** - Add permanently to the AutoCAD drawing
5. **Track** - Receive ObjectIds for downstream operations
